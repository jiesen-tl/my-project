# my-project
My first GitHub project.

Hi! I am a high school student from China passionate about C/C++.  
Currently, I am studying "C++ Primer", "The C++ Standard Library", and "Effective C++".  
I have solid experience in algorithms and enjoy solving problems with C++.  
I hope to collaborate with talented developers on GitHub and contribute to open-source projects.  
Let's code together!
